    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We follow these principles:
        Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
        through early and continuous delivery
        of valuable software.

        Welcome changing requirements, even late in
        development. Agile processes harness change for
        the customer's competitive advantage.

        Deliver working software frequently, from a
        couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
        preference to the shorter timescale.

        Business people and developers must work
        together daily throughout the project.

        Build projects around motivated individuals.
        Give them the environment and support they need,
        and trust them to get the job done.

        The most efficient and effective method of
        conveying information to and within a development
        team is face-to-face conversation.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working software is the primary measure of progress.

        Agile processes promote sustainable development.
        The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
        to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

        Continuous attention to technical excellence
        and good design enhances agility.

        Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
        of work not done--is essential.

        The best architectures, requirements, and designs
        emerge from self-organizing teams.

        At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
        to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
        its behavior accordingly.
