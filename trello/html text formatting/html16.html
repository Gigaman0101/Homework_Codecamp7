    <h1>Chocolate brownie</h1>
    <hr width="100%">
    <p>A chocolate brownie or simply a brownie is a square or rectangular chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a
        variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. They may include nuts, frosting,
        cream cheese, chocolate chips, or other ingredients. A variation made with brown sugar and vanilla rather than
        chocolate in the batter is called a blond brownie or blondie. The brownie was developed in the United States at
        the end of the 19th century and popularized in the U.S. and Canada during the first half of the 20th century.

        Brownies are a form of sheet cake. They are typically eaten by hand, often accompanied by milk, served warm with
        ice cream (a la mode), topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar and fudge. In North America
        they are common homemade treats and they are also popular in restaurants and coffeehouses.</p>
